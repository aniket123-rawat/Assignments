        "Public Members: By default, all attributes and methods in a Python class are public. They can be accessed directly from outside the class using the dot operator.\n",
        "\n",
        "Protected Members (Convention): A single leading underscore (_) before an attribute or method name conventionally indicates that it is intended for internal use within the class or its subclasses. While not strictly enforced by the interpreter, it serves as a strong signal to developers to avoid direct external access.\n",

This mechanism provides a stronger form of \"privacy\" compared to the single underscore convention.\n",
